# 前言

你正在阅读的这本书可以追溯到几年前。这一切都始于2014年我在Christian Alfoni博客上发表的评论。我最近发现了webpack和React，我觉得需要一本关于这些主题的食谱。这项工作始于2015年初的GitHub维基。
The book you are reading right now goes years back. It all started with a comment I made on Christian Alfoni’s blog in 2014. I had recently discovered webpack and React, and I felt there was a need for a cookbook about the topics. The work began with a GitHub wiki in early 2015.

过了一会儿，我意识到这应该成为一本*实际的*书，并尝试将它推销给一个已知的出版商。由于他们还没兴趣，我觉得这本书需要发生，我开始了**生存.JS **的努力。这本书歪曲成“SurviveJS  -  Webpack and React”，这是我的第一本自己出版的书。它将这两个主题合并为一本书。
After a while, I realized this should become an *actual* book and tried pitching it to a known publisher. As they weren’t interested yet and I felt the book needed to happen, I started the **SurviveJS** effort. The book warped into "SurviveJS - Webpack and React", my first self-published book. It combined the two topics into one single book.

因为专注于单一技术的书籍可以更高，所以我最终在2016年将书分成两个单独的书。当前版本代表了它的webpack部分，并且由于更加专注，它已经显着增长。这个旅程并不是一个短暂的旅程，但由于社区的支持和对该主题的持续关注，这一点很有可能。
Because a book focusing only on a single technology can stand taller, I ended up splitting the book into two separate ones in 2016. The current edition represents the webpack portion of it, and it has grown significantly due to this greater focus. The journey has not been a short one, but it has been possible thanks to community support and continued interest in the topic.

在这些年里，webpack已经转变为一个项目。包括我自己在内的核心团队不再依赖于单一的多产作者，而是围绕该项目发展壮大，吸引了更多人来支持这项工作。
During these years webpack has transformed as a project. Instead of relying on a single prolific author, a core team including myself has grown around the project, and has attracted more people to support the effort.

有一个[开放的集体活动]（https://opencollective.com/webpack）来帮助项目在财务上取得成功。此外，我将30％的账面收益捐赠给托比亚斯，因为他已经超过了托比亚斯。通过支持本书，你可以帮助webpack开发，因为大部分利润都归于其核心团队。
There is an [open collective campaign](https://opencollective.com/webpack) to help the project to succeed financially. Also, I am donating 30% of the book earnings to Tobias as he has more than earned it. By supporting the book, you help webpack development as most of the profit goes to its core team.
