# 前言

我是如何从webpack开始的，这是一个有趣的故事。在沉迷于 JavaScript 之前，我也是用 Java 开发的。我当时尝试过GWT（Google Web Toolkit）。 GWT 是一个 Java-to-JavaScript 编译器，它有一个很棒的特性：[代码分割](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html)。我喜欢这个功能，但在现有的JavaScript 工具中错过了它。我打开[问题](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7)到现有的模块捆绑器，但它没有继续。 Webpack诞生了。
It’s a funny story how I started with webpack. Before getting addicted to JavaScript, I also developed in Java. I tried GWT (Google Web Toolkit) in that time. GWT is a Java-to-JavaScript Compiler, which has a great feature: [code splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html). I liked this feature and missed it in existing JavaScript tooling. I opened [an issue](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7) to an existing module bundler, but it did not go forward. Webpack was born.

不知何故，Instagram前端团队发现了webpack的早期版本，并开始将其用于instagram.com。管理Instagram网络团队的Facebook员工Pete Hunt在OSCON 2014上发表了[关于webpack的第一次重要讨论]（https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkTCL6Nqm6Y）。这次谈话提升了webpack的受欢迎程度。 Instagram采用webpack的原因之一是**代码拆分**。
Somehow the Instagram frontend team discovered an early version of webpack and started to use it for instagram.com. Pete Hunt, Facebook employee managing the Instagram web team, gave [the first significant talk about webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkTCL6Nqm6Y) at OSCON 2014. The talk boosted the popularity of webpack. One of the reasons for adoption of webpack by Instagram was **code splitting**.

我从一开始就一直关注这本书。它曾经是React和webpack的结合书。它从那时起就成长起来，成为一本充满内容的书。
I have been following this book since its early stages. It was once a combined React and webpack book. It has grown since then and become a book of its own filled with content.

Juho是webpack文档的webpack文档团队的重要组成部分，因此他最了解官方文档的补充。他利用这些知识创建了一本书，为你提供了对webpack的深刻理解，并教你使用该工具发挥其全部潜力。
Juho is an important part of the webpack documentation team for the webpack documentation, so he knows best what complements the official documentation. He has used this knowledge to create a book that supplies you with a deep understanding of webpack and teaches you to use the tool to its full potential.
